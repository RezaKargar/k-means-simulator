# K-Means simulator

## Intro
This simulator helps you to visualy see how clustering algorithms such as `K-Means`, `X-Means` and `K-Medoids` work.
You can see each iteration of algorithms when their runnig or step by step iterate of steps of algorithms.


## Contirbution

Feel free to choose one of [TODOs](#TODOs) and implemented or solve a issue and then create a pull request.

### TODOs
- [x] Adding menu UI and some more user friendly UI components
- [ ] Refactoring the code:
    - [x] Separate to the files
    - [ ] Removing redunent codes and logics
- [ ] Implementing X-Means
- [ ] Implementing K-Mediods
- [x] Adding modes for runnig KMeans:
    - [x] step-by-step with forward/backward actions
    - [x] just-final-result
    - [x] animational with control over time and pause and play actions
- [ ] Implementing choosing Centroids manually for test purposes in K-Means and K-Medoids
